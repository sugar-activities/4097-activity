	 <title>Create a drawing or an animation</title>
	 <description>Free drawing and animation tool.</description>
	<prerequisite>Needs to be capable of moving and clicking the mouse easily</prerequisite>
	<goal>In this game, children can draw freely. The goal is to discover how to create attractive drawings based on basic shapes: rectangles, ellipses and lines. To give children a wider range of choices, a set of images can also be used.</goal>
	<manual>Select a drawing tool on the left, and a color down the bottom. Then click and drag in the white area to create a new shape. Once you've completed a drawing, you can take a snapshot of it with the 'camera' button. This creates a new image with the same content, a copy of your image. You can then edit it by moving objects a little bit or adding/deleting objects. When you create several drawings and then click on the 'film' button, you will see all your images in a continuous slide-show (an infinite loop pattern). You can also change the viewing speed in this mode. In viewing mode, click on the 'drawing' button to return to drawing mode. You can then edit each image in your animation, by using the image selector in the bottom-left corner of the screen. You can also save and reload your animations with the 'floppy disk' and 'folder' buttons.</manual>
